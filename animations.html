		Description: Explorations of programs using arrays of consecutive images to display animated objects.
		
		Functionality: In the runAnimation function, place the name of the folder as the first argument,
						the number of images in the folder as the second argument, and the location (image holder)
						of the animation as the third argument. All of the images in the folder must be named "image"
						followed by an ascending number starting with one.
						
						The default image is called "image0" and should remain in the root folder.
